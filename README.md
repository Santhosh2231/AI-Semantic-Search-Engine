# <b>SearchIt</b>: AI-Semantic-Search-Engine

The aim of this project is to implement a semantic search using artificial intelligence. You will develop a search engine that encodes the user's query into a vector and searches for similarity within a body of text. The user can store all the text to be searched using a vector database like Pinecone. This search engine will be designed to provide accurate and relevant search results.

## Components:
<li>Vector Database: You will need to choose a vector database like Pinecone to store the text that will be searched. The vector database will be used to store and index the text documents.</li>
<li>Vectorization Algorithm: You will need to implement a vectorization algorithm that encodes the text documents into a vector representation. You can use Open AIâ€™s latest text embeddings to vectorize the search query and the text documents to be searched from.</li>
<li>Similarity Search Algorithm: You will need to implement a similarity search algorithm that can find the most similar documents to the user's query. The algorithm should be optimized for speed and accuracy.</li>
<li>User Interface: You will need to develop a user interface that allows users to enter their queries and view the search results. The interface should be intuitive and easy to use.</li>
